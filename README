  (Sorry, it is written in Japanese only.)

Overview
--------
The Geeklog Media Gallery Plugin (formerly called Media Gallery WKZ) is 
an integration of Media Gallery v1.6.1 Japanese version (released by maruyo) 
and Media Gallery v1.6.8 (glFusion CMS version).

Note in case of upgrade
-----------------------
Media Gallery can upgrade from Media Gallery v1.6.1 Japanese version.
But, in Media Gallery, the layout of files was mainly changed compared with
Media Gallery v1.6.1 Japanese version. It is because I had to change things 
when I integrated the Media Gallery from glFusion. Therefore, if you upgrade, 
be careful.

Before upgrade, Please make sure to back up previous versions of files and
databases.

Media files are stored during operation was registered under the following four
directories. Keep these directories and files under the following directories
left.

public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/covers
public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/disp
public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/orig
public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/tn

All other files, please replace the files in the archive of Media Gallery.
Then please update Mediagallery plugin in the plugin administration page.

Setting Permissions
-------------------
The following directory permissions must be set 757 (or 777).

private/plugins/mediagallery/tmp

public_html/mediagallery/mediaobjects/disp   and the following directories

Change Log for Version 1.7.3
------------------------
* Fixed remote upload of media issue
* Fixes for PHP 7 and 8.1
* Fix for comments not taking into account user permissions on item

Change Log for Version 1.6.10
------------------------
From Version 1.6.10 I extend the functionality of the glFusion version.

(1) Imported some of the version 1.6.10 of glFusion.

    It seems that some Autotag been added.

(2) JQuery JavaScript library support.

    Use jQuery in place of MooTools, Media Gallery works.
    It changes by $_MG_CONF['js_lib'] which is defined in config.php.

(3) New template (theme) were added.

    Added the following three templates.
    * css_layout :        As its name suggests,avoid table layout,this is the CSS
                          layout. Finished my taste.
    * jquery_ad-gallery : This template is built in AD-Gallery. AD-Gallery is a 
                          well-known software created by jQuery.
    * jquery_colorbox :   This template is built in Colorbox. Colorbox is a 
                          well-known software created by jQuery.
    NOTE: jquery_ad-gallery and jquery_colorbox works on jQuery mode only.

(4) New frame template were added by new method.

    * new_border
    * new_shadow
    These frame templates, abolishing the table layout, and using the normal 
    thtml and CSS files. Probably everyone has more easy to handle.
    In a 'public_html/frames' folder, Please check the 'new_border' folder
    and the 'new_shadow' folder.

(5) Support square (150x150) cropped thumbnails.

    It generates with the normal thumbnails simultaneously.
    To create the square thumbnail of existing images, run 'Rebuild Thumb'.

(6) Added the mode go to the next image, when you click the image.

    Previously, when you click the image was switched image size (full or normal).
    In order to enable it change $_MG_CONF['click_image_and_go_next']
    which is defined in config.php.

(7) Improved PHP block function phpblock_mg_randommedia.

    Added arguments to phpblock_mg_randommedia. By them You can adjust the
    display image. The format is as follows.

    phpblock_mg_randommedia(geometry, maximum_width)

    'geometry' is set to 0 or 1. (default:0)
        0: The image aspect ratio is the same as the original image.
        1: Image aspect ratio is 1, it is a square.
    'maximum_width' is set to ranges of 10-200 in pixels.
        The default value is the setting value of
        'Media Gallery Administration'->'System Options'->'Random Image Block Width'.
        The maximum width is evaluated as the maximum height.
    Ex.
        phpblock_mg_randommedia(1,150)
        The image will be 150x150 pixels square.

(8) Added settings to config.php.

    For more information, please see the comments in config.php.
